Graph Query Language
Created to solve a particular problem Facebook was having. 

REST APIs were not being flexible when trying to make very specific requests of data.

Having to create nested routes and several endpoints to accoplish this was not being very usable.

GraphQL solves this problem by providing a query language that allows us to get or modify only what we want.

## Research

typeDefs
Resolvers
graphiqlExpress middleware
graphqlExpress middleware

## Apollo 

Allows us to use GraphQL in our applications (both server and client)
