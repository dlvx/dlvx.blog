## About me

<!--
Hello all!

My name is JosÃ© Del Valle and I am a Software Engineer from Costa Rica. 
Welcome to my blog, where we will talk, share and learn about everything Javascript.

I have chosen Javascript as the main theme for this blog not only because it has been the main language in my toolbox but because its versatility and features, its growth and all the cool frameworks, libraries and tools that have born from it. 

In this blog, we will discuss about the core concepts of Javascript, its mysteries and tricks, front-end and back-end libraries and frameworks, unit testing, development tools and a very wide spectrum of related topics. 

Today's Software Development in general evolves at a very fast pace and there's something new to learn every day and Javascript is no exception. Let's learn together and share our knowledge so we all can grow and deliver better software, better apps, better websites and better tools. 

Do you want to be a rockstar JS dev? Keep reading! I promise I will always try to do my best when it comes to share my knowledge and also to keep up with the latest trends in the field. 

Why? 

I gratuated as a Software Engineer from the Universidad Nacional ---National University--- from Costa Rica in 2015, and have worked since then.
